# Serve static files

### Usage

Clone the repository and run

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Once `npm run build` has completed, a folder called `dist` will be generated.
It will hold the static files that can be uploaded to any webserver (NGinx / Apache ecc..).

You can test this out simply by drag and dropping the `dist` folder into Netlify (https://app.netlify.com/).
